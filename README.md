## Notes
In order to use MongoDB you need to make a cluster on official MongoDB site , should look something like this:<br>
```mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@cluster0.ncd9v.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority```<br>
If you have an eror regarding the cluster you need to give it Network Access and add your current ip address <br><br>


## Bot
The Bot was made out of fun for killing the boredom for the user , other users can't see it cuz it's not broadcasted and it's not being saved into database
